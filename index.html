          Mountain View Hacks is a 4 day hackathon that will be held on
          March 14th, 2023 at Mountain View Middle School, and submissions will be due by March 17th. This is Mountain View's first ever hackathon, and
          we are excited to see what you will create!

          <h2>Origins</h2>
          <p>
            Mountain View Hacks was created by Pranav Behal. He wanted to bring a hackathon to Mountain View to let others experience the magic of coding and collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>Mountain View Hacks is meant to be a beginner-friendly coding experience in which participants can learn the basics of coding in a semi-competitive manner. This event is great for those who want to want to learn more about the STEM field, or maybe want to get a feel for how STEM competitions (such as hackathons or clubs like TSA and Science Olympiad) are. This hackathon is only avaiable to students of Mountain View Middle School.</p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>At the end of the day, we want our participants to have learned about STEM, specifically coding and development. Our hackathon allows participants to create any project they want, as long as it involves a level of coding. Mountain View Hacks was made to help students get a hands on experience with coding, while not commiting to joining a club; students understand what programming is, and whether or not they want to pursue it further.</p></div>
      <div class="for-who-text-div two-split-div two-split-div-right">
      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
      <p>This hackathon is for students of Mountain View Middle School who are interested in coding and development. This hackathon is meant to be a beginner-friendly experience, so no prior coding experience is required. We'll be teaching the basics of coding, such as hosting an intro to HTML workshop. We only ask that you join with an open mind and wanting to learn!
