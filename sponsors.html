    <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Our goal with Mountain View Hacks is to inspire the next generation of computer scientists by letting them get a hands-on experience with STEM and coding. In middle schools, not many students are exposed to real career activities that they could do; we hope to change this with Mountain View Hacks</p>
    <p>By donating and sponsoring Mountain View Hacks, you are showing the world that you care about the next generation of programmers, and that you want to help them get the resouces and experience that they need.</p>
    <p>For most students attending this hackathon, this is their first semi-competitive coding experience. We created Mountain View Hacks to be a beginner-friendly hackathon where they have the freedom and time to learn and explore different pathways in Computer Science, such as Web Development and Game Development. </p>
    <p>We hope that with your support, we will be able to give students a hands-on look into the CS field and let them experiment and learn with no limits.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>By sponsoring us, you have access to numerous perks, such as having your products used by attendees. Below is a breakdown of the different tiers of sponsorships we offer.</p>
